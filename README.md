# Jira Standup Stats Generator

A Tampermonkey script that adds a statistics panel to JIRA for tracking ticket progress and generating standup reports.

## Features

### 1. Statistics Types

- **Daily Statistics**: Shows tickets completed on a specific date
- **Weekly Statistics**: Shows ticket progress over different week periods (current week, last week, up to 4 weeks ago)

### 2. Configurable Settings

The script allows customization of:

- Current User: The JIRA username to track
- Complete Status From: The starting status for completion tracking (e.g., "In Progress")
- Complete Status To: The target status for completion tracking (e.g., "Ready for Peer Review")
- In Progress Statuses: List of statuses considered as "in progress"

Settings are persisted in local storage for convenience.

### 3. Calculations and Logic

#### Daily Statistics

- **Total Tickets**: Count of tickets that changed from "Complete Status From" to "Complete Status To" on the selected date
- **Points Completed**: Sum of story points from completed tickets

#### Weekly Statistics

- **Carryover Tickets**: Tickets assigned to the user before the week started (determined using JIRA Changelog API)
- **New Tickets**: Tickets assigned to the user during the selected week (determined using JIRA Changelog API)
- **Completed Tickets**: Total tickets that moved to completion status during the week
- **Bug Tickets**: Count of completed tickets marked as bugs
- **User Story Tickets**: Count of completed tickets that are not bugs
- **Total Points**: Sum of story points from all tickets
- **Completed Points**: Same as total points (all tickets in results are completed)

### 4. API and Query Logic

The script uses multiple JIRA APIs to gather comprehensive ticket data:

#### Main Ticket Query (JQL)

```sql
assignee WAS currentUser()
AND status changed FROM "{completeStatusFrom}" TO "{completeStatusTo}"
DURING (startOfWeek(), endOfWeek())
AND status NOT IN ("{inProgressStatus1}", "{inProgressStatus2}")
```

#### Changelog API Usage

For weekly statistics, the script uses JIRA's Changelog API (`/rest/api/3/issue/{key}/changelog`) to:

1. Fetch the complete history of each ticket
2. Find the exact timestamp when the ticket was assigned to the user
3. Compare this timestamp with the week boundaries to classify the ticket as:
   - **Carryover**: Assignment date < week start date
   - **New**: Week start date ‚â§ Assignment date < week end date

This provides accurate tracking of when tickets entered your workload, regardless of their current status.

#### Daily Query

```sql
assignee WAS currentUser()
AND status changed FROM "{completeStatusFrom}" TO "{completeStatusTo}"
ON "{date}"
AND status NOT IN ("{inProgressStatus1}", "{inProgressStatus2}")
```

### 5. Features

- Copy formatted statistics for standup reports
- Settings persistence in local storage
- Visual feedback for actions (saving settings, copying stats)
- Error handling and loading states
- Responsive UI that matches JIRA's design
